# HTML-Base-Template
<p> This is a basic HTML5 template to easily start your project. You don't need to worry about loading your CSS stylesheet or jQuery. </p>
<p> This Project contains built-in styles for HTML objects such as links, buttons, paragraphs, navigation, tables, images, lines and others. </p>

<p> Included in "HTML Base Template" is FeatherLight, a simple solution to display images and content in a lightbox, simply add data-featherlight="image" and your image will be displayed in a beautiful overlay. </p>
